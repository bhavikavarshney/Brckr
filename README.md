# Brckr: Brick-Breaker
'Brckr' is made in Python. It is one of the classic games by the name Brick Breaker. <br>
Some bricks contains power-ups like the ball speed is decreased, paddle speed or width is increased etc.<br>
The game is over when all the bricks are destroyed or the ball touches the bottom of the screen.<br><br>
I made this around 2021 when I started out with building games in python.
